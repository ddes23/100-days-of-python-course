# The code needs to print the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

# Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

# When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

# When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".

# And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

# ORIGINAL CODE

# for number in range(1, 101):
#   if number % 3 == 0 or number % 5 == 0:
#     print("FizzBuzz")
#   if number % 3 == 0:
#     print("Fizz")
#   if number % 5 == 0:
#     print("Buzz")
#   else:
#     print([number])

#SOLUTION - 
# 1. Print output was printing brackets as if from a list. 
# 2. Needed to change the 2 statements after the first line from "if" to "elif"
# 3. In the IF statement needed to change the operator from 'or' to 'and' 

for number in range(1, 101):
  if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
  elif number % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
  elif number % 5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
  else:
    print(number)
