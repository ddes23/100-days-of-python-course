# <!-- Data Overlap
# ðŸ’ª This exercise is HARD ðŸ’ª 
# Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line. 
# You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files. 
# e.g. if file1.txt contained: 

# 1 

# 2 

# 3

# and file2.txt contained: 

# 2

# 3

# 4

# result = [2, 3]


# IMPORTANT:  The output should be a list of integers and not strings!

# Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.   -->

file1 = open("file1.txt")
file2 = open("file2.txt")
numbers1 = [int(num) for num in file1]
numbers2 = [int(num) for num in file2]
result = [num for num in numbers1 if num in numbers2]
print(result)

#instructors Solution

    list1 = file1.readlines()
    
with open("file2.txt") as file2:
