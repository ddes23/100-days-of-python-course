#Python has a number of built in functions. The course has been using many up to this point
print("Hello")
#functions pretty much work the same. The function is acting upon what's in the ()
num = len("Hello")
print(num)

#What if you wanted to make your own function. Start with keyboard of "def" for "(def)ining"

    print("Hello")
    print("Bye")
